# Loans Data Exploration
## by Rodrigo Dalamangas


## Dataset

This document explores a dataset containing interest rates and their attributes for approximately 114000 loans from November 2005 to March 2014. The dataset can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv), with feature documentation available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0).


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found a strong relationship between borrower's APR interest rate and the financial situation at the moment someone goes to ask for a loan. After the analysis I can say that people who is home owner will have better borrower's APR interest rates and access to a higher loan amounts as much as their income increases.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on show the influence of variables that represents the financial situation of borrowe's and how it influence the borrower's APR interest rate. I introduced the variable of interest with a histogram plot then I present a violin plot to show the relation between the two numeric variables (borrower's APR and Loan Amount) over the two categorical variables (borrower's income range and borrower's is home owner). Finally, I present a point plot to check the relation between borrower's APR, borrower's income range and borrower's is home owner.
